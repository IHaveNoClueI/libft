# libft

Your very first own library
Summary: The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that you’ll be allowed to use in all your other projects.

C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to those highly useful standard functions.

This project makes you to take the time to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them.

This library will help you for all your future C projects.

Through this project, we also give you the opportunity to expand the list of functions with your own.

Take the time to expand your libft through out the year
